This folder contains 3 files, the python script used to scrape the data, the data collected and stored as csv, and the exploratory data analysis report. 

The python script was built from scratch and utilized python libraries such as 'request' and 'BeautifulSoup' to facilitate in web scrapping. Using both libraries, data about the top 250 moveis were gathered from IMDB, an online database for information related to tv shows, movies and similar media.

The data gathered from IMDB website was then stored as a csv file located in the folder. The conversion and organization of the data was done thru the Pandas library. 

A brief exploratory data analysis was also conducted to analyze basic aspects of the top 250 movies.
